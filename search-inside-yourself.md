## (1-8) Introduction

Imagine whenever you meet anybody, your habitual, instinctive first thought is, I wish for this person to be happy.



## (9-28) CHAPTER ONE - Even an Engineer Can Thrive on Emotional Intelligence

EI: The ability to monitor one's own and others' feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions.

In the context of the work environment, emotional intelligence enables three important skill sets: stellar work performance, outstanding leadership, and the ability to create the conditions for happiness.

And that optimal state of being is "a profound emotional balance struck by a subtle understanding of how the mind functions."

Therefore, happiness may be an unavoidable side effect of cultivating emotional intelligence.

There is an ability called "response flexibility," which is a fancy name for the ability to pause before you act.

"Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our happiness." What a mind of calmness and clarity does is to increase that space for us.

There is a simple technique for self-regulation called "affect labeling," which simply means labeling feelings with words. When you label an emotion you are experiencing (for example, "I feel anger"), it somehow helps you manage that emotion.

When we are trying to perceive an emotion, we usually get more bang for the buck if we bring our attention to the body rather than the mind.

Necause emotion has such a strong physiological component, we cannot develop emotional intelligence unless we operate at the level of physiology. That is why we direct our mindfulness there.

The basal ganglia observes everything we do in life, every situation, and extracts decision rules... Our life wisdom on any topic is stored in the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is so primitive that it has zero connectivity to the verbal cortex. It can't tell us what it knows in words. It tells us in feelings, it has a lot of connectivity to the emotional centers of the brain and to the gut. It tells us this is right or this is wrong as a gut feeling.

To just be is simultaneously the most ordinary and the most precious experience in life.



## (29-50) CHAPTER TWO Breathing as if Your Life Depends on It

By non-doing, all doing becomes possible.

Meditation: A family of mental training practices that are designed to familiarize the practitioner with specific types of mental processes.

Mindfulness trains two important faculties, attention and meta-attention.

When your meta-attention becomes strong, you will be able to recover a wandering attention quickly and often, and if you recover attention quickly and often enough, you create the effect of continuous attention, which is concentration.

When the mind is calm and clear at the same time, happiness spontaneously arises. The mind becomes spontaneously and naturally joyful!

happiness is the default state of mind.

happiness is not something that you pursue; it is something you allow. Happiness is just being. That insight changed my life.

"Grandmother mind": adopting the mind of a loving grandmother. To a loving grandmother, you are beautiful and perfect in every way.

Remember that the goal of this practice is not keeping still; the goal is mindfulness. So as long as you maintain mindfulness, anything you do is fair game.

Yes, we start with training of attention, but attention is not the end goal of most meditation traditions; the true end goal is insight. The reason we create a powerful quality of attention is to be able to develop insights into the mind.

The Dalai Lama said, "If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims." 



## (51-78)  CHAPTER THREE Mindfulness Without Butt on Cushion

We take for granted many of the neutral things in life, such as not being in pain, having three meals a day, and being able to walk from point A to point B. In mindfulness, these become causes of joy because we no longer take them for granted.

"Listening is magic: it turns a person from an object outside, opaque or dimly threatening, into an intimate experience, and therefore into a friend. In this way, listening softens and transforms the listener." 

Do less than you can: This lesson came from Mingyur Rinpoche. The idea is to do less formal practice than you are capable of. For example, if you can sit in mindfulness for five minutes before it feels like a chore, then do not sit for five minutes— just do three or four minutes, perhaps a few times a day. The reason is to keep the practice from becoming a burden.

The better you are at letting go, the better you are at both meditating and falling asleep.

Using joy as an object of meditation, especially the type of joy with a gentle quality that doesn't overwhelm the senses. For example, taking a nice walk, holding hands with a loved one, enjoying a good meal, carrying a sleeping baby, or sitting with your child while she is reading a good book are great opportunities to practice mindfulness

In my opinion, the best translation of sukha is its most technical translation: "non-energetic joy." Sukha is a quality of joy not requiring energy.

There are two complementary qualities of attention: focused attention and open attention.

It's like my daughter plateauing at two steps for months and then suddenly, in the space of two days, becoming able to walk. To the casual observer, it may look like she learned to walk in just two days, but in reality, she did it over three months. It is her constant practice over three months that enabled the last two days of sudden progress and mastery.



## (79-102)  CHAPTER FOUR All-Natural, Organic Self-Confidence

The moment you can see an emotion, you are no longer fully engulfed in it.

I am able to project that confidence not because I make the effort to look confident, but because I have a sense of humor about my ego, or my own sense of self-importance.

In my engineer's mind, I think of it as understanding two important modes I operate in: my failure mode and my recovery mode. If I can understand a system so thoroughly I know exactly how it fails, I will also know when it will not fail. I can then have strong confidence in the system, despite knowing it is not perfect, because I know what to adjust for in each situation.

Journaling: My engineer's way of looking at it is an unfiltered brain dump— dumping your mind-stream onto paper. A more poetic way of looking at it is seeing your thoughts as a gently flowing stream and trying to capture that flow on paper.

We usually think of our emotions as being us. This is reflected in the language we use to describe them. For example, we say, "I am angry" or "I am happy" or "I am sad," as if anger, happiness, or sadness are us, or become who we are. To the mind, our emotions become our very existence.

In meditative traditions, we have a beautiful metaphor for this insight. Thoughts and emotions are like clouds— some beautiful, some dark— while our core being is like the sky. Clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena in the sky that come and go.



## (103-130) CHAPTER FIVE Riding Your Emotions like a Horse

While we cannot stop an unwholesome thought or emotion from arising, we have the power to let it go, and the highly trained mind can let it go the moment it arises.

The key is to let go of two things: grasping and aversion. Grasping is when the mind desperately holds on to something and refuses to let it go. Aversion is when the mind desperately keeps something away and refuses to let it come. These two qualities are flip sides of each other. Grasping and aversion together account for a huge percentage of the suffering we experience, perhaps 90 percent, maybe even 100 percent.

The key insight here is that grasping and aversion are separate from sensation and perception. They arise so closely together that we do not normally notice the difference.

The second important opportunity is the possibility of experiencing pleasure without the aftertaste of unsatisfactoriness. The biggest problem with pleasant experiences is that they all eventually cease. The experience itself causes no suffering, but our clinging on to them and our desperate hoping that they do not go away cause suffering.

Four very helpful general principles for dealing with any distressing emotions are: 1. Know when you are not in pain. 2. Do not feel bad about feeling bad. 3. Do not feed the monsters. 4. Start every thought with kindness and humor.

we cannot stop monsters from arising or force them to leave, but we have the power to stop feeding them.

So every time I fail, it is a comedy. And since I fail so often, my life is a great comedy.

Dealing with Triggers: 1. Stop 2. Breathe 3. Notice 4. Reflect 5. Respond

Ultimately, self-regulation is about making friends with our emotions.



## (131-158) CHAPTER SIX Making Profits, Rowing Across Oceans, and Changing the World

He describes three types of happiness: pleasure, passion, and higher purpose.

Interestingly, we instinctively chase after pleasure believing it to be the source of sustainable happiness. Many of us spend most of our time and energy chasing pleasure, sometimes enjoying flow, and once in a while, we think about higher purpose. Tony's insight suggests we should be doing precisely the reverse.

The best motivators are what he calls "intrinsic motivators"— motivation we find within ourselves. The three elements of true motivation are:

When you know yourself at a deep level, you begin to understand your core values, purposes, and priorities.

Things like values and higher purposes are fairly abstract topics, and the act of verbalizing them forces us to make them clearer and more tangible to ourselves.

Envisioning is based on a very simple idea: it's much easier to achieve something if you can visualize yourself already achieving it.

If everything in my life, starting from today, meets or exceeds my most optimistic expectations, what will my life be in five years?

One is to write your own obituary, as Roz did, and if you like, write two versions like Roz did. Another is to visualize this scene: You are attending a talk as part of a large audience. Everybody in the audience, including you, is deeply touched and inspired by what the speaker is saying. That speaker is your future self twenty years from now.

We can train resilience on three levels: 1. Inner calm: Once we can consistently access the inner calm in the mind, it becomes the foundation of all optimism and resilience. 2. Emotional resilience: Success and failure are emotional experiences. By working at this level, we can increase our capacity for them. 3. Cognitive resilience: Understanding how we explain our setbacks to ourselves and creating useful mental habits help us develop optimism.

What distinguishes successful people is their attitude toward failure, and specifically, how they explain their own failures to themselves.

We naturally pay much more attention to negative than positive occurrences in our lives.

The first step to learning optimism is becoming aware of our own strong negative experiential bias.

When experiencing failure, focus on realistic evidence suggesting that this setback may be temporary.


## (159-192) CHAPTER SEVEN Empathy and the Monkey Business of Brain Tangos

Empathy works by having you physiologically mimic the other person.

The more kindness you offer to people, the better you can empathize with them. 

Empathy also increases with perceived similarity.

Hence, to become more empathetic, we need to create a mind that instinctively responds to everyone with kindness and an automatic perception of others being "just like me." In other words, we need to create mental habits.

"Whatever one frequently thinks and ponders upon, that will become the inclination of his mind."

For example, if every time you see another person, you wish for that person to be happy, then eventually, it will become your mental habit and whenever you meet another person, your instinctive first thought is to wish for that person to be happy. After a while, you develop an instinct for kindness. You become a kind person. Your kindness shows in your face, posture, and attitude every time you meet somebody. People will become attracted to your personality, not just your good looks.

In other words, kindness is a sustainable source of happiness— a simple yet profound insight that can change lives.

Empathy helps us build trust. When we interact with empathy, we increase the likelihood that people feel seen, heard, and understood. When people feel those things, they feel safer and more likely to trust the person who understands them.

When team members trust the intentions of each other enough that they are willing to expose their own vulnerabilities because they are confident their exposed vulnerabilities will not be used against them. Hence, they are willing to admit issues and deficiencies and ask for help.

When establishing trust, I find that my cognitive brain is usually easy to deal with— the hard part is placating my emotional brain. To placate the emotional brain, I must recognize that the other person is a human being just like me.

Specifically, there are four things we can do to strengthen our ability for empathic listening. 1. Mindfulness: With mindfulness, we become more perceptive and receptive. 2. Kindness: When we are kind, we can listen better to feelings. 3. Curiosity: Practice wondering what someone might be feeling when you hear their stories. 4. Practice: Just do a lot of empathic listening. The more you do it, the better you become, especially when you practice it in conjunction with mindfulness, kindness, and curiosity.

Begin the conversation by thinking to yourself, "I want this person to be happy."

It turns out that you can undermine people by praising them, even when you are doing it with the best of intentions!

In contrast, when a person is given process praise, it reinforces a "growth mind-set," or the belief that our qualities can be developed through dedication and effort, and therefore that success comes from dedication and effort. This creates a love of learning and resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Thus, when giving feedback, it is best to do so in a way that encourages a growth mind-set. Simply put, it's better to praise people for working hard than for being smart.

It is entirely possible for both sides to be 100 percent correct and 100 percent reasonable and still have conflict.

Chief among those mental habits is kindness. Having the mental habit of kindness means that every time you interact with a human being, the thoughts in your mind that arise habitually and effortlessly are, "This person is a human being just like me. I want him or her to be happy."

Another mental habit is being open to understanding how other people can seem reasonable, at least from their own points of view, even when you disagree with them.


## (193-228) CHAPTER EIGHT Being Effective and Loved at the Same Time

"You can make more friends in two months by becoming really interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. Which is just another way of saying that the way to make a friend is to be one." - Dale Carnegie

The most effective naval commanders are also the ones with higher emotional intelligence and who are most liked.

Compassion is also the cause for the highest level of happiness ever measured, and it's a necessary condition for the most effective form of leadership known.

There has to be a combination of seclusion from the world (to deepen the calmness) and engagement with the world (to deepen the compassion).

Compassion is a mental state endowed with a sense of concern for the suffering of others and aspiration to see that suffering relieved.

[Jinpa] defines compassion as having three components: 1. A cognitive component: "I understand you" 2. An affective component: "I feel for you" 3. A motivational component: "I want to help you"

I tell all my friends that if they only read one business book in their entire lives, the one to read is Good to Great.

Collins calls them "Level 5" leaders. These are leaders who, in addition to being highly capable, also possess a paradoxical mix of two important and seemingly conflicting qualities: great ambition and personal humility.

Five domains of social experience that the brain treats as primary rewards or threats:  These five domains form a model which David calls the SCARF model, which stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness.

The good news is there is a good way to increase your own status without harming others, and that is what David calls "playing against yourself." When you improve a skill (such as improving your golf handicap), you activate a status reward relative to your former self. This is perhaps why mastery is such a powerful motivator (see Chapter 6). When you gain increasing mastery over something that matters to you, you activate a status reward, at least when compared against your former self.

Humans are the only animals known to voluntarily injure their own self-interests to punish the perceived unfairness of others. Other primates are known to punish unfairness, but not at the expense of their own self-interest.

Empathy is a necessary ingredient for effective communication, but empathy is not always enough. I have seen even empathetic people get themselves into very frustrating conversations. The missing element is insight, specifically insight into the often hidden elements of a conversation, such as the identity issues involved and what impact was caused versus what was intended.

There are five steps to conducting a difficult conversation. Here is my brief of those steps: 1. Prepare by walking through the "three conversations." 2. Decide whether to raise the issue. 3. Start from the objective "third story." 4. Explore their story and yours. 5. Problem solve. 9

John, who knows everything that happened but is totally uninvolved, is the third story. The third story is the best one with which to start a difficult conversation. It is the most objective and the one with which you are most likely to form a common ground with the other party. Use this third story to invite the other party to join you as a partner in sorting out the situation together.

Impact is not the intention. For example, if we feel hurt by something somebody said, we may automatically assume that the person intended to hurt us.

The second key insight is that beyond the content and emotions in every difficult conversation, there are, more importantly, issues of identity. Very often the identity issues are the most hidden and left unsaid, but they are usually the most dominant.

When the brain receives insufficient data about others' feelings, it just makes stuff up.



## (229-238) CHAPTER NINE Three Easy Steps to World Peace

Think of the mind as a snow globe that is shaken constantly. When you stop shaking the snow globe, the white "snow" particles within it eventually settle, and the fluid in the snow globe becomes calm and clear at the same time. Similarly, the mind is normally in a constant state of agitation. With deep mental relaxation and alertness, the mind settles into calmness and clarity. In this mind, the third quality, inner happiness, naturally emerges.

Hence, in a serious way that is almost comical, the key active ingredient in the formula for world peace may be something as simple as meditation. It's such a simple solution to such an intractable problem, it is almost absurd. Except it may actually work.



## EPILOGUE Save the World in Your Free Time

All these bodhisattvas think of their tireless work for humanity as little more than having fun by doing whatever comes most naturally to them.
