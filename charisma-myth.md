### Charismatic Behaviors

Three core elements: presence, power, and warmth.

Being present means simply having a moment-to-moment awareness of what’s happening. It means paying attention to what’s going on rather than being caught up in your own thoughts.

The very next time you’re in a conversation, try to regularly check whether your mind is fully engaged or whether it is wandering elsewhere (including preparing your next sentence. Aim to bring yourself back to the present moment as often as you can by focusing on your breath or your toes for just a second, and then get back to focusing on the other person.

The combination of power and warmth would have been very rare and very, very precious: a powerful person who also viewed us kindly could mean the difference between life and death in critical moments.

Nonverbal communication is hardwired into our brains, much deeper than the more recent language- processing abilities.

If your internal state is anticharismatic, no amount of effort and willpower can make up for it. Sooner or later, some of your underlying thoughts and feelings will show through. On the other hand, if your internal state is charismatic, then the right body language will flow forth effortlessly.

Imaginary situations cause your brain to send your body the same commands as it would for a real situation . Whatever your mind believes, your body will manifest. Just by getting into a charismatic mental state, your body will manifest a charismatic body language.

### Obstacles to Presence, Power and Warmth

Because most of us tend to interpret events— whether they’re personal or impersonal— as relating to us.

Because this tendency to compare is wired very deeply in our brains, trying to fight it can take a lot of effort. Instead, notice when you’re making comparisons and use the responsibility transfer technique to alleviate any internal discomfort it may have caused.

### Overcoming the Obstacles

Skillfully handling any difficult experience is a three-step process: destigmatize discomfort, neutralize negativity, and rewrite reality.

You see, shame is the real killer. Of all the emotions that human beings can feel, it is one of the most toxic to health and happiness. Shame researcher Brené Brown defines it as "the fear of being unlovable: Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging."

And in basic survival terms, if the tribe rejects you, you die. It is a life-and-death situation. The brain equates social needs with survival; being hungry and being ostracized activate similar neural responses. Somewhere in the back of our minds is the fear of being so disapproved-of that we’d be excluded by those who matter to our survival.

One of the main reasons we’re so affected by our negative thoughts is that we think our mind has an accurate grasp on reality, and that its conclusions are generally valid . This, however, is a fallacy. Our mind’s view of reality can be, and often is, completely distorted.

Visual inputs our eyes take in every moment , we consciously perceive very few. The conscious awareness of absolutely everything around us would be overwhelming.

"I decide to interpret everything favorably toward myself. It’s not just that I’m optimistic, I’m actually conveniently deluded."

### Creating Charismatic Mental States

There is good evidence that imagining oneself performing an activity activates parts of the brain that are used in actually performing the activity.

Next time you’re feeling anxious, you might want to imagine being wrapped up in a great big hug from someone you care about.

Every night… [Napoleon Hill] held an imaginary council meeting with this group whom [he] called my ‘Invisible Counselors.’

We all know that few things will ruin someone’s chances more than giving off an impression of desperation, whether they’re on a job interview or on a date. Gratitude is a great antidote to all of these negative feelings because it comes from thinking of things you already have—from material items or experiences to cherished relationships.

No matter whom it is you’re talking to, find three things to appreciate or approve of— even if these are as small as "their shoes are shined" or "they were on time."

In any interaction, imagine the person you’re speaking to, and all those around you, as having invisible angel wings.

Neuropsychologist Rick Hanson asserts that humans are by far the most empathetic species on the planet.

Displaying confident body language will actually make you feel more confident; these feelings will in turn affect your body language, which will adapt accordingly, displaying yet more confident signals. This will give you yet another feeling boost, and the cycle will build upon itself.

Willpower is a bit like a muscle that fatigues depending on how much we use it. If we draw on our willpower to resist a temptation or to put up with a certain annoyance, it will be weaker when we need it for another activity soon after. In fact, exerting willpower physically fatigues us. It is a finite resource, so be strategic about where and when you expend it.

### Different Charisma Styles

Why is visionary charisma so effective and powerful? Because of our natural discomfort with uncertainty. In a constantly changing world, we crave something solid to cling to.

### Charismatic First Impressions

Faced with the choice between changing one’s mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.

Good question to ask when meeting someone for the first time: "What was it like growing up there?"

As the MIT Media Lab studies showed, what impacts people isn’t the words or content used. Rather, they remember how it felt to be speaking with you. You might not remember the exact content of conversations you had a week ago, but you probably do remember how they felt. It’s not the words but the conversation’s emotional imprint that remains.

### Speaking and Listening with Charisma

Even if what you’re thinking about is what you want to say next, your lack of presence will be written all over your face.

It takes confidence to bear silence, both because of the awkwardness you may feel and because of the uncertainty of not knowing what they’re thinking during those two seconds.

You can make more friends in two months by becoming truly interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

One classic exercise to hone your projection skills is to imagine that your words are arrows. As you speak, aim them at different groups of listeners.

### Charismatic Body Language

When you consciously mirror someone’s body language, you activate deep instincts of trust and liking.

Keep eye contact for three full seconds at the end of your interaction with someone.

High-confidence body language is characterized by how few movements are made.

### Difficult Situations

This technique has become known as the Ben Franklin Effect. Having lent Franklin the book, the opponent had to either consider himself as inconsistent (having done a favor for someone he disliked) or rationalize his action by deciding that he actually rather liked Franklin. "I did something nice for this person, so I must like him. 

Asking for someone’s opinion is a better strategy than asking for their advice, because giving advice feels like more effort.

For instance, instead of "Great job," you could say, "You did a great job," or, better yet, "The way you kept your calm when that client became obnoxious was impressive."

If you’re having trouble pausing, try color-coding your speeches.
