## Introduction - How I Learnedto Be Jolly for Fun and Profit

A 1996 study involving twins suggests that roughly half of our happiness is associated with our genetic makeup. (Location 201)

Mindfulness is defined as "paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally." (Location 230)

If you want to become an agent of change, you have to remember to keep your sense of humor. (Location 281)

What is even better is if we can feel joy independent of sense or ego pleasure. (Location 292)

Joy that comes from within—from a peaceful mind as a result of taking a few breaths, joy from being kind toward others (which involves other people but does not depend on them), joy from our own generosity, joy from doing the right thing—all this joy is ours to have, independent of circumstances. (Location 345)

My Asian upbringing had led me to believe that success leads to happiness, that one day, when I am successful, I will be happy. In fact, the opposite is true. Success does not lead to happiness; instead, happiness leads to success. (Location 366)

The single greatest advantage in the modern economy is a happy and engaged workforce. (Location 372)

Joy and meditation are another pair of really nice things that form a virtuous cycle with each other. (Location 403)


## Chapter 1 - Joy Becomes You

Any one of the three basic benefits of mind training — mental calm, mental clarity, and emotional resilience — is, by itself, life changing, and with practice all meditators can acquire all three. (Location 496)

Creativity seems to happen when random ideas arise and the mind perceives them clearly and, more important, captures the novel, remote, or unexpected associations between these ideas. If the mind is cluttered, noisy, or agitated, it is like dropping pebbles into turbulent water—you don’t see a lot of nice ripples, and you can’t see how the ripples form patterns with each other. (Location 550)

That is why they know to go for walks, play games, or take a warm shower if they get stuck while solving a problem. (Location 569)

The biggest difference is that cockiness, unlike confidence, is necessarily fueled by conceit. Another big difference is fragility. Cockiness is very fragile. (Location 588)

The second source of confidence is confidence arising from equanimity. This comes in part from the ability to calm the mind on demand. (Location 646)

Focusing on serving the people in front of me, I allowed my ego to be any size it needed to be in order to serve, and I maintained my humor at the absurdity of the situation. (Location 677)

In retrospect, I realized that I had handled that monk’s question in the most skillful way I could without even thinking. I could have been defensive, offended, angry, or insecure, and I could have acted in a very unskillful way. I learned that if I just focus on service and humor, then I will most likely not screw it up. (Location 688)

That brings us to the third source of confidence, confidence arising from resilience. One aspect of confidence arising from resilience is the ability to recover: (Location 695)

This is the willingness to bear witness to our own pain and failure. (Location 722)

Charisma is the result of specific behaviors: behaviors of presence, behaviors of power, and behaviors of warmth. (Location 771)

Behaviors of warmth, in my opinion, can be reduced to a single sentence: "I’m so happy to see you." (Location 784)

I realized the secret of my success can be encapsulated in a single word: luck. I am so successful because I am lucky. (Location 793) 1. Being born into the right circumstances 2. Being in the right place at the right time 3. Being surrounded by good people (Location 797)

Venturing into the uncomfortable takes two things: the self-confidence to put yourself in very uncomfortable situations, and the self-awareness to clearly know your values, priorities, and purpose in life. (Location 828)

In life, opportunity knocks fairly often, but if you are unprepared for it or unwilling to jump at it, then it will pass you by. (Location 840)

The skills you need to do this are the self-awareness that gives you clarity of purpose, the self-confidence to know you are capable of learning anything at any age, the resilience to do outstanding work even in unpleasant situations, and the courage to "fly between trapezes" and put yourself in uncomfortable situations. (Location 844)


## Chapter 2 - Just One Breath? Sure You Jest

Simply, if you have people to exercise with, for example gym buddies or running buddies, then you’re more likely to do it. The second solution is incorporating exercise into daily life. (Location 891)

If sports were invented by us engineers, we would have called it "gamified exercise." (Location 905)

The most important thing about this is self-sustaining momentum. Once a person hits the Joy Point, the virtuous cycle of joy and skillfulness keeps her going. She has the skill to reliably access inner peace and inner joy, which makes her practice joyful, so she practices more and becomes more skillful, which makes her practice more joyful, and so on. (Location 929)

This is wise laziness. Using insight and wisdom to maximize ease without sacrificing quality of results, (Location 949)

(Taking breath while you wait) is a wonderful practice with many benefits. First, I never waste any time anymore, because every moment I wait is a moment I get to spend productively, practicing mindfulness meditation. (Location 1120)

The two short-lived sources of joy are the joy of novelty and the joy of perceived agency. (Location 1150)

The first highly sustainable source of joy is the joy of momentary relief from affliction. (Location 1173)

The second highly sustainable source of joy is the joy of ease. (Location 1180)


## Chapter 3 - From One Breath to One Googol

The first method is anchoring. This means bringing gentle attention to a chosen object, and if attention wanders away, gently bringing it back. If anchoring is too hard for you, here is the second method: resting. Resting means exactly that, to cease work or movement in order to relax, that is all. If resting is still too hard for you, here is the third method: being. Being means shifting from doing to being. It means not doing anything in particular, just sitting and experiencing the present moment. (Location 1258)

The traditional Sanskrit word for meditation is bhavana, which literally means "cultivation." A key aspect of meditation is the skillful combination of wise effort and letting go. (Location 1352)

The Buddha taught that a skillful goldsmith does three things while working on a piece of gold: periodically he strengthens the fire, periodically he sprinkles water onto the gold, and periodically he examines the gold closely. Similarly, a skillful meditator periodically does three things: periodically he arouses mental energy, periodically he calms the mind, and periodically he watches the mind with equanimity. (Location 1387)

I decided I would sit on a chair and literally do nothing. It turned out that nothing was precisely what I needed to do. After just a few minutes of sitting and doing nothing, I became aware of feelings in my body, so I just sat there being aware of bodily sensations. Some minutes after that, I noticed myself breathing. And then I told myself, "Oh, so this is what it is like to know that you are breathing." (Location 1479)

However, from that one experience, I learned the most important lesson in all of meditation practice: first and foremost, establish relaxation, and if relaxation breaks, reestablish relaxation. (Location 1486)

I gave myself firm instructions such as, "I will attend to every single in-breath and out-breath, not losing attention to a single breath, for thirty minutes." There was only one rule, the relaxation rule: first and foremost, establish relaxation, and if relaxation breaks, reestablish relaxation. (Location 1499)

Mental training requires a skillful balance of disciplined effort and joyful relaxation, which means the more joyful relaxation you can already count on, the more disciplined effort you can commit, and the more of both you have, the faster you can establish attentional stability. (Location 1518)


## Chapter 4 - What, Me Happy?

The more you notice these thin slices of joy, the more they appear to be everywhere, because they have always been there. You just never noticed them before. (Location 1578)

The Discourse on Proximate Causes (the Upanisa Sutta), states emphatically that "the proximate cause of concentration is joy." In other words, joy is the condition most immediately responsible for (meditative) concentration. (Location 1650)

There are three sources of wholesome joy in daily activities that we can tap. One source is the type of behavior that uplifts the spirits, such as behavior involving generosity, loving-kindness, and compassion. (Location 1690)

Ethical behavior is another day-to-day source of wholesome joy. (Location 1692)

Another source of wholesome joy is attending to pleasant experiences in your normal, everyday activities. (Location 1705)

One of the biggest hindrances, possibly the biggest hindrance, to perceiving the very many moments of joy in daily life is a phenomenon called habituation, which for our purpose simply means we take things for granted. (Location 1759)

The third and, possibly, the most powerful way to overcome habituation is with a strong awareness of mortality. Someday, I will die. (Location 1782)

One study shows that the less time someone feels she has remaining on this earth, the more likely she is to derive happiness from ordinary experiences, and therefore, the happier she is. (Location 1796)

I spent my life thinking of freedom as the freedom to do stuff, but that freedom turns out to be trivial compared to the much greater freedom from affliction. (Location 1841)

This practice is, without a doubt, one of the most important meditation practices of all time. Meditation master Shinzen Young said that if he were allowed to teach only one focus technique and no other, it would be this one. Here are the instructions for the informal practice of Just Note Gone, from Shinzen’s article "The Power of Gone." (Location 1877)


## Chapter 5 - Uplift the Mind in Seconds

It turns out that being on the giving end of a kind thought is rewarding in and of itself. To simply think that I wish for one other person to be happy makes me happy. (Location 1985)

If that is true, we may have just discovered one of the most important secrets of happiness. All other things being equal, to increase your happiness, all you have to do is randomly wish for somebody else to be happy. That is all. It basically takes no time and no effort. This is another key life-changing insight in this book. You’re welcome. (Location 1995)

Simply stated, loving-kindness is the wish for self or others to be happy, and compassion is the wish for self or others to be free from suffering. (Location 2052)

Compassion, in contrast, is significantly harder because it forces us to come face-to-face with suffering. (Location 2078)

I was shocked. Compassion is the happiest mental state ever measured in the history of neuroscience. (Location 2109)

When I experience sadness with equanimity, three qualities arise: courage, confidence, and most important, selfless love. (Location 2122)

He calls healthy sadness "the courage of compassion." He says this is the type of sadness that inspires a loving response in you that compels you to take courageous action to relieve suffering. The difference between healthy and unhealthy sadness is despair. Healthy sadness is sadness without despair. (Location 2138)

The most surprising thing I have learned about altruistic joy is how hard it is to cultivate. In my experience, altruistic joy is much harder to cultivate than loving-kindness and compassion. (Location 2194)

As a meditator, it is obvious to me that one’s own mind is always the first beneficiary of any altruistic intention; therefore, it is impossible to commit any act out of true altruistic intent without first benefiting oneself. (Location 2210)

Hence, one of the few things in my life that can reduce my constant sense of inadequacy is reflecting on my sincere, altruistic intentions, and by extension, the good deeds that result from the intentions and the occasional good outcome of those deeds (on those occasions when my good deeds go unpunished). (Location 2237)

At the beginning of every meditation session, uplift the mind with altruistic joy. (Location 2253)

The three qualities in this chapter, loving-kindness, compassion, and altruistic joy, are three in a collection of four beautiful qualities called brahmavihara. The fourth member of that club is equanimity, which is the mind that remains calm and free in the face of eight worldly conditions: gain and loss, honor and dishonor, praise and blame, and pleasure and pain. (Location 2285)

In fact, I know of meditation masters who use loving-kindness as their main vehicle for arriving at states of perfect meditative concentration. (Location 2311)

I most strongly recommend practicing compassion, and doing so after some foundation in loving-kindness is firmly established. (Location 2323)

Loving-kindness has two near enemies, both of which are often dominant in romantic relationships, which is why those relationships tend to go sour over time. (Location 2337)

- Loving Kindness: Near Enemies are "Addictive Affection" and "Conditional Love". Far Enemy is "Ill Will"
- Compassion: Near Enemites are "Despair" and "Pity". Far Enemy is "Cruelty"
- Altruistic Joy: Near Enemies are "Self-Interested Joy" and "Unwholesome Joy". Far Enemy is "JEalousy"
- Equanimity: Near Enemies are "Disengagement" and "Apathy". Far Enemy is "Agitation"


## Chapter 6 - Happiness is Full of Crap

In this chapter, we will use inner peace, inner joy, inner clarity, and loving-kindness to work with suffering. I suggest there are three steps in doing that: an attentional step, an affective step, and a cognitive step. (Location 2442)

First, I learned, as the masters have taught over thousands of years, that peace and joy are the default states of mind. They don’t have to be created—they just need to be accessed. (Location 2508)

Complementing the willingness to experience joy in the midst of emotional pain is the willingness to experience the emotional pain itself. (Location 2569)

In summary, the affective step begins with the willingness to experience joy in the midst of emotional pain, allowing the joy to surface whenever and wherever it wants. After that, cultivate the willingness to experience the emotional pain itself. Do this by perceiving the affective experience of the emotional pain in its component parts (bodily sensations, thoughts, and aversion) clearly, just as they are. Then, apply loving-kindness to yourself as much as possible; then sit with whatever bodily sensations and thoughts you experience, doing so in stillness and equanimity, allowing all those bodily sensations and thoughts to come and go, knowing that they are not you. (Location 2625)

To make things worse, we often unconsciously fill in the missing information with our imagination and then our brains don’t take the trouble to differentiate between imagination and facts. (Location 2644)

As the comedian Louis C. K. famously said to Conan O’Brien, "Everything is amazing right now, and nobody’s happy." (Location 2663)

Cognitively reappraise a situation in six ways: (Location 2678)

The three steps for working with emotional pain (the attentional step, the affective step, and the cognitive step) work best when executed in that order. (Location 2699)

"When a buddha meets a sad person, the buddha becomes sad for one moment. Why is this? Because if he didn’t, the sad person would have no way to meet the buddha." (Location 2718)

Only when you can clearly see how you fail will you be able to overcome the causes of those failures. (Location 2781)

Matthieu and Tania demonstrated scientifically that altruistic love and compassion are antidotes for suffering. (Location 2824)


## Chapter 7 - The Great Mind Is Better than Sex

That makes sense because when I was growing up, meditation was far from mainstream, so the population that self-selected into meditation had to have very strong motivation to venture that far out, and in almost every case, that motivation was unbearable pain. (Location 2883)

If you are someone who wants to establish a deep practice in a small number of months, you can’t beat buying a one-way ticket to Thailand and checking yourself into a Buddhist forest monastery in the middle of a thick rainforest with an enlightened, no-nonsense master. (Location 2893)

"To acquire wisdom is very hard, but to abandon it is even harder. You have obviously accumulated a lot of wisdom, and your wisdom has brought you to this point, which is very good. But to advance further, you need to abandon that wisdom." (Location 2925)

Suddenly, I saw that the biggest barrier to my progress was my effort. The very effort that had accelerated my progress was holding me back from the next stage of my growth. (Location 2939)

The meditator only reapplies effort when attentional stability wanes (and withdraws effort again soon after). (Location 2947)

With effort withdrawn, the mind glides into a deeply calm and quiet state. In the background, there is attention to the breath, but in the foreground, the attention is objectless. (Location 2948)

Even the breath itself is a concept, a concept made up of many successive moments of sensation that the mind integrates as the experience of breath. (Location 3045)

When the observer has no identity, the observer gains experiential realization that identity is entirely mind-made. Identity has no substance whatsoever—it is nothing but a mere creation of mind. (Location 3091)

In fact, I can summarize my entire twenty-plus years of meditation practice in just two words: letting go. (Location 3169)

The title of the text is Tenzo Kyokun, which literally means "instructions for the monk in charge of cooking meals" (Location 3213)
