### Introduction

Ultimately, the losses forced us to do something extraordinarily difficult: to back out of the business that the company was founded upon, and to focus on another business that we thought we were best at— the microprocessor business.


We did all this because under this strong attack, we learned that we must lead with our strength. Being second best in a tough environment is just not good enough.

The consequence of all this is very simple. If the world operates as one big market, every employee will compete with every person anywhere in the world who is capable of doing the same job. There are a lot of them, and many of them are very hungry.

But between the two is a large group of people— the middle managers, who supervise the shop-floor foremen, or who work as engineers, accountants, and sales representatives. Middle managers are the muscle and bone of every sizable organization, no matter how loose or “flattened” the hierarchy, but they are largely ignored despite their immense importance to our society and economy.

Teachers, market researchers, computer mavens, and traffic engineers shape the work of others through their know-how just as much as or more than the traditional manager using supervisory authority.

And when the unexpected happens, you should double your efforts to make order from the disorder it creates in your life.

“Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos.”

As a micro CEO, you can improve your own and your group’s performance and productivity, whether or not the rest of the company follows suit.

The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence.

High managerial productivity, I argue, depends largely on choosing to perform tasks that possess high leverage.

A team will perform well only if peak performance is elicited from the individuals in it.

You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.

Are one-on-one meetings still needed? Absolutely. Can you have them as often with ten direct reports as with five? No. Do you need to? No again, because for the most part, these employees are more aware of what’s going on in their business through their computer network

As a general rule, you have to accept that no matter where you work, you are not an employee— you are in a business with one employee: yourself.

The key to survival is to learn to add more value— and that ultimately is what this book is about.

From my own experience at Intel, I strongly believe that applying the methods of production, exercising managerial leverage, and eliciting an athlete’s desire for peak performance can help nearly everyone— lawyers, teachers, engineers, supervisors, even book editors; in short, middle managers of all kinds— to work more productively.


### Foreword

“When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.”

“I have seen far too many people who upon recognizing today’s gap try very hard to determine what decision has to be made to close it. But today’s gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past.”

If you only understand one thing about building products, you must understand that energy put in early in the process pays off tenfold and energy put in at the end of the program pays off negative tenfold.

“CEOs always act on leading indicators of good news, but only act on lagging indicators of bad news.”


### Part 1: The Breakfast Factory

build and deliver products in response to the demands of the customer at a scheduled delivery time, at an acceptable quality level, and at the lowest possible cost.

The key idea is that we construct our production flow by starting with the longest (or most difficult, or most sensitive, or most expensive) step and work our way back.

process manufacturing, an activity that physically or chemically changes material just as boiling changes an egg; assembly, in which components are put together to constitute a new entity just as the egg, the toast, and the coffee together make a breakfast; and test, which subjects the components or the total to an examination of its characteristics.

Breakfast preparation, college recruiting, sales training, and compiler design are very much unlike one another, but all of them possess a basically similar flow of activity to produce a specific output.

The point is that whenever possible, you should choose in-process tests over those that destroy product.

All production flows have a basic characteristic: the material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process. A boiled egg is more valuable than a raw one, a fully assembled breakfast is more valuable than its constituent parts, and finally, the breakfast placed in front of the customer is more valuable still.

A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible.

If we compile the cost of the effort that goes into securing a conviction and assign it only to those criminals who actually end up in jail, we find that the cost of a single conviction works out to be well over a million dollars— an absolutely staggering sum. The number is so high, of course, because only a very small percentage of the flow of accused persons makes it all the way

The number of possible indicators you can choose is virtually limitless, but for any set of them to be useful, you have to focus each indicator on a specific operational goal.

First, you’ll want to know your sales forecast for the day. How many breakfasts should you plan to deliver?

Your next key indicator is raw material inventory.

Finally, you want to have some kind of quality indicator. It is not enough to monitor the number of breakfasts each waiter delivers, because the waiters could have been rude to the customers even as they served a record number of breakfasts.

So because indicators direct one’s activities, you should guard against overreacting. This you can do by pairing indicators, so that together both effect and counter-effect are measured. Thus, in the inventory example, you need to monitor both inventory levels and the incidence of shortages.

Because those listed here are all quantity or output indicators, their paired counterparts should stress the quality of work.

Leading indicators give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like. And because they give you time to take corrective action, they make it possible for you to avoid problems. Of course, for leading indicators to do you any good, you must believe in their validity.

But even more important, the improvement or deterioration of the forecasted outlook from one month to the next provides the most valuable indicator of business trends that I have ever seen.

I have found the “stagger chart” the best means of getting a feel for future business trends.

So even though you would much rather build to order, you will have to use another way to control the output of your factory. In short, you will have to build to forecast, which is a contemplation of future orders.

What works better is to ask both the manufacturing and the sales departments to prepare a forecast, so that people are responsible for performing against their own predictions.

The order for the product and the product itself should arrive at the shipping dock at the same time.

But if we have carefully chosen indicators that characterize an administrative unit and watch them closely, we are ready to apply the methods of factory control to administrative work.

Without rigor, the staffing of administrative units would always be left at its highest level and, given Parkinson’s famous law, people would find ways to let whatever they’re doing fill the time available for its completion.

The key principle is to reject the defective “material” at its lowest-value stage.

While in most instances the decision to accept or reject defective material at a given inspection point is an economic one, one should never let substandard material proceed when its defects could cause a complete failure— a reliability problem— for our customer. Simply put, because we can never assess the consequences of an unreliable product, we can’t make compromises when it comes to reliability.

As a rule of thumb, we should lean toward monitoring when experience shows we are not likely to encounter big problems.

Because quality levels vary over time, it is only common sense to vary how often we inspect.

If the manager examined everything his various subordinates did, he would be meddling, which for the most part would be a waste of his time. Even worse, his subordinates would become accustomed to not being responsible for their own work, knowing full well that their supervisor will check everything out closely.

The productivity of any function occurring within it is the output divided by the labor required to generate the output.

Here I’d like to introduce the concept of leverage, which is the output generated by a specific type of work activity. An activity with high leverage will generate a high level of output; an activity with low leverage, a low level of output. For example, a waiter able to boil two eggs and operate two toasters can deliver two breakfasts for almost the same amount of work as one.

Automation is certainly one way to improve the leverage of all types of work. Having machines to help them, human beings can create more output.

Typically, you will find that many steps exist in your work flow for no good reason. Often they are there by tradition or because formal procedure ordains it, and nothing practical requires their inclusion.

As we will see, in the work of the soft professions, it becomes very difficult to distinguish between output and activity. And as noted, stressing output is the key to improving productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite.


### Part 2: Management is a Team Game

individual contributors who gather and disseminate know-how and information should also be seen as middle managers, because they exert great power within the organization.

My day always ends when I’m tired and ready to go home, not when I’m done. I am never done. Like a housewife’s, a manager’s work is never done.

But reports also have another totally different function. As they are formulated and written, the author is forced to be more precise than he might be verbally. Hence their value stems from the discipline and the thinking the writer is forced to impose upon himself as he identifies and deals with trouble spots in his presentation. Reports are more a medium of self-discipline than a way to communicate information. Writing the report is important; reading it often is not.

This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager’s life. Other activities— conveying information, making decisions, and being a role model for your subordinates— are all governed by the base of information that you, the manager, have about the tasks, the issues, the needs, and the problems facing your organization.

Let’s call it “nudging” because through it you nudge an individual or a meeting in the direction you would like. This is an immensely important managerial activity in which we engage all the time, and it should be carefully distinguished from decision-making that results in firm, clear directives. In reality, for every unambiguous decision we make, we probably nudge things a dozen times.

In principle more money, more manpower, or more capital can always be made available, but our own time is the one absolutely finite resource we each have.

Managerial Output = Output of organization = L1 × A1 + L2 × A2 +…

Leverage can also be negative. Some managerial activities can reduce the output of an organization. I mean something very simple. Suppose I am a key participant at a meeting and I arrive unprepared. Not only do I waste the time of the people attending the meeting because of my lack of preparation— a direct cost of my carelessness— but I deprive the other participants of the opportunity to use that time to do something else.

Another example is waffling, when a manager puts off a decision that will affect the work of other people. In effect, the lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization.

if a senior manager sees an indicator showing an undesirable trend and dictates to the person responsible a detailed set of actions to be taken, that is managerial meddling.

The negative leverage produced comes from the fact that after being exposed to many such instances, the subordinate will begin to take a much more restricted view of what is expected of him, showing less initiative in solving his own problems and referring them instead to his supervisor.

Unless both parties share the relevant common base, the delegatee can become an effective proxy only with specific instructions. As in meddling, where specific activities are prescribed in detail, this produces low managerial leverage.

avoid the charade of insincere delegation,

delegation without follow-through is abdication.

Because it is easier to monitor something with which you are familiar, if you have a choice you should delegate those activities you know best.

How often you monitor should not be based on what you believe your subordinate can do in general, but on his experience with a specific task and his prior performance with it— his task-relevant maturity,

In short, if we determine what is immovable and manipulate the more yielding activities around it, we can work more efficiently.

maximize the use of the mental set-up time needed for the task.

To gain better control of his time, the manager should use his calendar as a “production” planning tool, taking a firm initiative to schedule work that is not time-critical between those “limiting steps” in the day.

To use your calendar as a production-planning tool, you must accept responsibility for two things: 1. You should move toward the active use of your calendar, taking the initiative to fill the holes between the time-critical events with non-time-critical though necessary activities. 2. You should say “no” at the outset to work beyond your capacity to handle.

There is an optimum degree of loading, with enough slack built in so that one unanticipated phone call will not ruin your schedule for the rest of the day. You need some slack.

Another production principle is very nearly the opposite. A manager should carry a raw material inventory in terms of projects.

As a rule of thumb, a manager whose work is largely supervisory should have six to eight subordinates;

As noted, we should try to make our managerial work take on the characteristics of a factory, not a job shop.

The most common problem cited was uncontrolled interruptions, which in remarkably uniform fashion affected both supervisory and know-how managers. Everyone felt that the interruptions got in the way of his “own” work.

By analogy, if you can pin down what kind of interruptions you’re getting, you can prepare standard responses for those that pop up most often.

But you can channel the time needed to deal with them into organized, scheduled form by providing an alternative to interruption— a scheduled meeting or an office hour.

Thus I will assert again that a meeting is nothing less than the medium through which managerial work is performed.

As we will see later, the most effective management style in a specific instance varies from very close to very loose supervision as a subordinate’s task maturity increases.

I feel that a one-on-one should last an hour at a minimum. Anything less, in my experience, tends to make the subordinate confine himself to simple things that can be handled quickly.

By applying Grove’s Principle of Didactic Management, “Ask one more question!” When the supervisor thinks the subordinate has said all he wants to about a subject, he should ask another question.

I take notes in just about all circumstances, and most often end up never looking at them again. I do it to keep my mind from drifting

One-on-ones should be scheduled on a rolling basis— setting up the next one as the meeting taking place ends.

the subordinate teaches the supervisor, and what is learned is absolutely essential if the supervisor is to make good decisions.

Staff meetings also create opportunities for the supervisor to learn from the exchange and confrontation that often develops.

The figure opposite shows that the supervisor’s most important roles are being a meeting’s moderator and facilitator, and controller of its pace and thrust.

Lack of interest undermines the confidence of the presenter.

So before calling a meeting, ask yourself: What am I trying to accomplish? Then ask, is a meeting necessary? Or desirable? Or justifiable? Don’t call a meeting if all the answers aren’t yes.

So a meeting involving ten managers for two hours costs the company $ 2,000. Most expenditures of $ 2,000 have to be approved in advance by senior people— like buying a copying machine or making a transatlantic trip— yet a manager can call a meeting and commit $ 2,000 worth of managerial resources at a whim.

Once the meeting is over, the chairman must nail down exactly what happened by sending out minutes that summarize the discussion that occurred, the decision made, and the actions to be taken.

if all goes well, routine meetings will take care of maybe 80 percent of the problems and issues; the remaining 20 percent will still have to be dealt with in mission-oriented meetings.

I would put it another way: the real sign of malorganization is when people spend more than 25 percent of their time in ad hoc mission-oriented meetings.

Here a rapid divergence develops between power based on position and power based on knowledge, which occurs because the base of knowledge that constitutes the foundation of the business changes rapidly.

Put another way, even if today’s veteran manager was once an outstanding engineer, he is not now the technical expert he was when he joined the company. At Intel, anyway, we managers get a little more obsolete every day.

the faster the change in the know-how on which the business depends or the faster the change in customer preferences, the greater the divergence between knowledge and position power is likely to be.

Usually when a meeting gets heated, participants hang back, trying to sense the direction of things, saying nothing until they see what view is likely to prevail. They then throw their support behind that view to avoid being associated with a losing position.

“What’s going on here? You people are talking in circles and getting nowhere.” After the chairman intervened, the problem was resolved in very short order. We named this the peer-plus-one approach,

In other words, it is legitimate— in fact, sometimes unavoidable— for the senior person to wield position-power authority if the clear decision stage is reached and no consensus has developed. It is not legitimate— in fact, it is destructive— for him to wield that authority any earlier.

Because the process is indeed onerous, people sometimes try to run away from it.

Step 1 is to establish projected need or demand: What will the environment demand from you, your business, or your organization? Step 2 is to establish your present status: What are you producing now? What will you be producing as your projects in the pipeline are completed? Put another way, where will your business be if you do nothing different from what you are now doing? Step 3 is to compare and reconcile steps 1 and 2. Namely, what more (or less) do you need to do to produce what your environment will demand?

You need to focus on the difference between what your environment demands from you now and what you expect it to demand from you a year from now.

If marketing knew they could sell 100 widgets per month but thought that manufacturing could only deliver ten, and so submitted a demand forecast of ten units, manufacturing would never tool up to satisfy the real demand.

What do you need to do to close the gap? The second is, What can you do to close the gap? Consider each question separately, and then decide what you actually will do, evaluating what effect your actions will have on narrowing the gap, and when. The set of actions you decide upon is your strategy.

I have seen far too many people who upon recognizing today’s gap try very hard to determine what decision has to be made to close it. But today’s gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past.

I, for one, hardly ever look at the bound volume finally called the Annual Plan. In other words, the output of the planning process is the decisions made and the actions taken as a result of the process.

We should also be careful not to plan too frequently, allowing ourselves time to judge the impact of the decisions we made

Because the idea that planners can be people apart from those implementing the plan simply does not work.

1. Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2. How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results.)

For example, if we plan on a yearly basis, the corresponding MBO system’s time frame should be at least as often as quarterly or perhaps even monthly.

We must realize— and act on the realization— that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say “yes” to and what we say “no” to— which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work.

If the supervisor mechanically relies on the MBO system to evaluate his subordinate’s performance, or if the subordinate uses it rigidly and forgoes taking advantage of an emerging opportunity because it was not a specified objective or key result, then both are behaving in a petty and unprofessional fashion.


### Part 3: Team of Teams

Things have become very complicated. Sometimes as I sit behind my big desk at corporate headquarters, I wish I could go back to the early days when I was getting the eggs and toast and pouring the coffee myself. Or if not that, at least back to the days when I was running a single Breakfast Factory, and I knew everybody by name

“Good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.” Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.

Intel is a hybrid organization: balancing to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.

What are some of the advantages of organizing much of a company in a mission-oriented form? There is only one. It is that the individual units can stay in touch with the needs of their business or product areas and initiate changes rapidly when those needs change. That is it.

All other considerations favor the functional-type of organization.

Here I would like to propose Grove’s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.

If we at Intel tried to resolve all conflicts and allocate all resources at the top, we would begin to resemble the group that ran the Hungarian economy. Instead, the answer lies with middle managers.

A strictly functional organization, which is clear conceptually, tends to remove engineering and manufacturing (or the equivalent groups in your firm) from the marketplace, leaving them with no idea of what the customers want.

But we should not expect to escape from complexity by playing with reporting arrangements. Like it or not, the hybrid organization is a fundamental phenomenon of organizational life.

In her main job, her knowledge affects the work that takes place in one plant; in her second, through what she does in the process coordinating group, she can influence the work of all plants.

Similarly, our behavior in a work environment can be controlled by three invisible and pervasive means. These are: • free-market forces • contractual obligations • cultural values

But for lawbreakers we need policemen, and with them, as with supervisors, we introduce overhead.

You don’t need management to supervise the workings of free-market forces; no one supervises sales made at a flea market. In a contractual obligation, management has a role in setting and modifying the rules, monitoring adherence to them, and evaluating and improving performance.

Let’s apply our model to the work of a new employee. What is his motivation? It is very much based on self-interest. So you should give him a clearly structured job with a low CUA factor. If he does well, he will begin to feel more at home, worry less about himself, and start to care more about his team.


#### Part 4: The Players

In other words, everything we’ve considered so far is useless unless the members of our team will continually try to offer the best they can do. The means a manager has at his disposal to elicit peak individual performance are what the rest of this book is about.

When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.

motivation has to come from within somebody. Accordingly, all a manager can do is create an environment in which motivated people can flourish.

For Maslow, motivation is closely tied to the idea of needs, which cause people to have drives, which in turn result in motivation.

when a lower need is satisfied, one higher is likely to take over.

But people don’t want to belong to just any group; they need to belong to one whose members possess something in common with themselves.

us to show up for work, but other needs— esteem and self-actualization— make us perform once we are there.

A friend of mine was thrust into a premature “mid-life crisis” when, in recognition of the excellent work he had been doing, he was named a vice president of the corporation. Such a position had been a life-long goal. When he had suddenly attained it, he found himself looking for some other way to motivate himself.

Personal Best, captures what self-actualization means: the need to achieve one’s utter personal best in a chosen field of endeavor. Once someone’s source of motivation is self-actualization, his drive to perform has no limit.

Output will tend to be greater when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond his immediate grasp, even though trying means failure half the time.

My first job was with a research and development laboratory, where a lot of people were very highly motivated but tended to be knowledge-centered. They were driven to know more, but not necessarily to know more in order to produce concrete results. Consequently, relatively little was actually achieved.

So it appears that at the upper level of the need hierarchy, when one is self-actualized, money in itself is no longer a source of motivation but rather a measure of achievement. Money in the physiological- and security-driven modes only motivates until the need is satisfied, but money as a measure of achievement will motivate without limit.

The most important form of such task-relevant feedback is the performance review every subordinate should receive from his supervisor. More about this later.

You cannot stay in the self-actualized mode if you’re always worried about failure.

Is there a systematic way to lead people to self-actualization? For an answer, let’s ask another question. Why does a person who is not terribly interested in his work at the office stretch himself to the limit running a marathon? What makes him run? He is trying to beat other people or the stopwatch.

society respects someone’s throwing himself into sports, but anybody who works very long hours is regarded as sick, a workaholic.

when the competition is removed, motivation associated with it vanishes.

The inevitable conclusion is that high output is associated with particular combinations of certain managers and certain groups of workers. This also suggests that a given managerial approach is not equally effective under all conditions.

That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience.

Specifically, when the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement, in which the manager pays more attention to the subordinate as an individual than to the task at hand.

The fundamental variable that determines the effective management style is the task-relevant maturity of the subordinate.

The subordinate did poor work. My associate’s reaction: “He has to make his own mistakes. That’s how he learns!” The problem with this is that the subordinate’s tuition is paid by his customers. And that is absolutely wrong. The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external.

Even if we achieve it, if things suddenly change we have to revert quickly to the what-when-how mode. That mode is one that we don’t think an enlightened manager should use. As a result, we often don’t take it up until it is too late and events overwhelm us.

If the subordinate is a personal friend, the supervisor can move into a communicating management style quite easily, but the what-when-how mode becomes harder to revert to when necessary. It’s unpleasant to give orders to a friend.

it is to improve the subordinate’s performance. The review is usually dedicated to two things: first, the skill level of the subordinate, to determine what skills are missing and to find ways to remedy that lack;

Even the word “argument” is frowned upon, something I learned many years ago when I first came to this country from Hungary.

Don’t think for a moment that performance reviews should be confined to large organizations. They should be part of managerial practice in organizations of any size and kind, from the insurance agent with two office assistants to administrators in education, government, and nonprofit organizations.

To make an assessment less difficult, a supervisor should clarify in his own mind in advance what it is that he expects from a subordinate and then attempt to judge whether he performed to expectations.

“present value” used in finance: how much will the future-oriented activity pay back over time? And how much is that worth today?

The time offset between the manager’s work and the output of his organization was just about a year. Greatly embarrassed, I regretfully concluded that the superior rating I had given him was totally wrong.

Finally, as you review a manager, should you be judging his performance or the performance of the group under his supervision? You should be doing both.

One big pitfall to be avoided is the “potential trap.” At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential.

the performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the one we would accord to his organization!

The old saying has it that when we promote our best salesman and make him a manager, we ruin a good salesman and get a bad manager. But if we think about it, we see we have no choice but to promote the good salesman. Should our worst salesman get the job? When we promote our best, we are saying to our subordinates that performance is what counts.

There are three L’s to keep in mind when delivering a review: Level, listen, and leave yourself out.

To make sure you’re being heard, you should watch the person you are talking to.

All of us have had professors who lectured by looking at the blackboard, mumbling to it, and carefully avoiding direct eye contact with the class. The reason: knowing that their presentation was murky and incomprehensible, these teachers looked away from their audience to avoid confirming visually what they already knew.

The key is to recognize that your subordinate, like most people, has only a finite capacity to deal with facts, issues, and suggestions. You may possess seven truths about his performance, but if his capacity is only four, at best you’ll waste your breath on the other three.

Preferably, a review should not contain any surprises, but if you uncover one, swallow hard and bring it up.

Progress of some sort is made when the subordinate actively denies the existence of a problem rather than ignoring it passively, as before.

Once responsibility has been assumed, however, finding the solution is relatively easy. This is because the move from blaming others to assuming responsibility constitutes an emotional step, while the move from assuming responsibility to finding the solution is an intellectual one, and the latter is easier.

The stages of problem-solving: The transition from blaming others to assuming responsibility is an emotional step.

Don’t confuse emotional comfort with operational need. To make things work, people do not need to side with you; you only need them to commit themselves to pursue a course of action that has been decided upon.

We all have a hard time saying things that are critical, whether we’re talking to a superior employee or a marginal one. We must keep in mind, however, that no matter how stellar a person’s performance level is, there is always room for improvement. Don’t hesitate to use the 20/ 20 hindsight provided by the review to show anyone, even an ace, how he might have done better.

And under no circumstances should you pretend that you and your subordinates are equal during performance reviews.

Preparing and delivering a performance assessment is one of the hardest tasks you’ll have to perform as a manager. The best way to learn how to do one is to think critically about the reviews you yourself have received.

about impossible. The fact is, we managers have no choice but to perform the interview, no matter how hard it is. But we must realize that the risks of failure are high.

The other tool we have for assessing potential performance is to research past performance by checking references. But you’ll often be talking to a total stranger, so even if he comments freely about the candidate, what he says won’t have much meaning to you without some knowledge of how his company does business and what values it works by.


What are the subjects that you should bring up during an interview? A group of managers provided me with what they thought were the best questions. They were:

Another approach follows that you may want to use while interviewing. The candidate can tell you a great deal about his capabilities, skills, and values by asking you questions.


To this day I haven’t a clue about why I didn’t spot the candidate’s considerable flaws. So in the end careful interviewing doesn’t guarantee you anything, it merely increases your odds of getting lucky.

Make him talk, because after the prepared points are delivered, the real issues may come out. Don’t argue, don’t lecture, and don’t panic. Remember, this is only the opening skirmish, not the war. And you cannot win the war here— but you can lose it!

Money has significance at all levels of Maslow’s motivation hierarchy. As noted earlier, a person needs money to buy food, housing, and insurance policies, which are part of his physiological and safety/ security needs. As one moves up the need hierarchy, money begins to mean something else— a measure of one’s worth in a competitive environment.


But compromises can be set up. We can base a portion of a middle manager’s compensation on his performance. Let’s call this a performance bonus.

If we want to use such schemes, we have to come to terms with the principle— troubling to many managers— that any merit-based system requires a competitive, comparative evaluation of individuals. Merit-based compensation simply cannot work unless we understand that if someone is going to be first, somebody else has to be last.

Promotions must be based on performance, because that is the only way to keep the idea of performance highlighted, maintained, and perpetuated.


Thus, you’ll find two basic types of “meets” performers. One has no motivation to do more or faces no challenge to do more. This is the noncompetitor, who has become settled and satisfied in his job. The other type of “meets” performer is the competitor. Each time he reaches a level of “exceeds requirements,” he becomes a candidate for promotion. Upon being promoted, he very likely becomes a “meets” performer again. This is the person Dr. Peter wrote about. But we really have no choice but to promote until a level of “incompetence” is reached.

It is generally accepted that motivating employees is a key task of all managers, one that can’t be delegated to someone else. Why shouldn’t the same be true for the other principal means at a manager’s disposal for increasing output?
