### Intro, Globalization

The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.

I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.

In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.

If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.

The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

### Competition & Monopolies

Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create.

All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past.

War metaphors invade our everyday business language: we use headhunters to build up a sales force that will enable us to take a captive market and make a killing.

A great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future.

Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.

The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite.

The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.

### Luck

Statistics doesn’t work when the sample size is one.

Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it’s the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth.

### Secrets

There are easy truths that children are expected to rattle off, and then there are the mysteries of God, which can’t be explained. In between— the zone of hard truths— lies heresy.

From an early age, we are taught that the right way to do things is to proceed one very small step at a time, day by day, grade by grade. If you overachieve and end up learning something that’s not on the test, you won’t receive credit for it.

There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people.

### Foundations

A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.

The potential for conflict increases over time as interests diverge: a board member might want to take a company public as soon as possible to score a win for his venture firm, while the founders would prefer to stay private and grow the business.

Equity is a powerful tool precisely because of these limitations . Anyone who prefers owning a part of your company to being paid in cash reveals a preference for the long term and a commitment to increasing your company’s value in the future.

Since time is your most valuable asset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision any long-term future together.

### Distribution

Like acting, sales works best when hidden. This explains why almost everyone whose job involves distribution— whether they’re in sales, marketing, or advertising—has a job title that has nothing to do with those things. People who sell advertising are called "account executives.” People who sell customers work in "business development.” People who sell companies are "investment bankers.” And people who sell themselves are called "politicians.” There’s a reason for these redescriptions: none of us wants to be reminded when we’re being sold.

Viral Marketing -> Marketing -> Dead Zone -> Sales -> Complex Sales

One of these methods is likely to be far more powerful than every other for any given business: distribution follows a power law of its own. This is counterintuitive for most entrepreneurs, who assume that more is more. (One distribution channel is usually exponentially better than all others for a given business)

The press can help attract investors and employees. Any prospective employee worth hiring will do his own diligence; what he finds or doesn’t find when he googles you will be critical to the success of your company.

### Man and Machine

As computers become more and more powerful, they won’t be substitutes for humans: they’ll be complements.

If humans and computers together could achieve dramatically better results than either could attain alone, what other valuable businesses could be built on this core principle?

We’re impressed with small feats accomplished by computers alone, but we ignore big achievements from complementarity because the human contribution makes them less uncanny.

The most valuable companies in the future won’t ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they’ll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems?

### Seven questions that every business must answer

1. The Engineering Question: Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements? 

2. The Timing Question: Is now the right time to start your particular business? 

3. The Monopoly Question: Are you starting with a big share of a small market? 

4. The People Question: Do you have the right team? 

5. The Distribution Question: Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product? 

6. The Durability Question: Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? 

7. The Secret Question: Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?
