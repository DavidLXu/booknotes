### Lecture 14 - How to operate

The founder is like a task rabbit doing stuff for other people

Editing metaphor 

- As a founder you are editing other people's work, not writing most of it.
- Consistent voice across company copy

Simplicity: 

- Complexity is an excuse
- Many great products and companies were based on simple propositions, even if the technology was complex


Delegating: 

- People you work with should be coming up with their own initiatives, generally
- Based on task-relevant maturity: How mature is this person doing something?
- Micromanage if the person doesn't have experience doing that kind of task
- Don't micromanage if the person has experience with that kind of task
- If you're not sure about the "right" solution, let other people figure it out and fail
- 2x2 matrix: Conviction vs. Consequence

Details matter: 

- The food and office matters
- Internal (not customer facing) things matter: How beautiful the system is designed, dashboards, etc. Keep a high standard
- If you don't care about details people will complain and drag down everyone

Tasks:

- Only give people 1-3 tasks to work on!
- Do A+ tasks and delegate B tasks (but details matter!)
- Strech people's responsibilities over time until they "break"
- Can't build a company without effort

Hiring: 
  
- Ammunition vs. barrel metaphor

Dashboard: 

- Have a dashboard and make everyone look at it
- For every metric, there should be a countermetric (Frauds <-> False Positives)


Transparency:

- Transparent compensation may work, not sure
- Take notes at every meeting and circulate them
- Glass walls only, no concreate

Misc:

- Shared office spaces probably don't work. Startups are like a cult, and you can't do that when you're sharing your space with random people.
