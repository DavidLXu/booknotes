### Introduction

Types of failures:

- The first is ignorance— we may err because science has given us only a partial understanding of the world and how it works.
- The second type of failure the philosophers call ineptitude— because in these instances the knowledge exists, yet we fail to apply it correctly.

Getting the steps right is proving brutally hard, even if you know them.

The first is the fallibility of human memory and attention, especially when it comes to mundane, routine matters that are easily overlooked under the strain of more pressing events.

Checklists seem to provide protection against such failures. They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.

Three different kinds of problems in the world: the simple, the complicated, and the complex.

You want people to make sure to get the stupid stuff right. Yet you also want to leave room for craft and judgment and the ability to respond to unexpected difficulties that arise along the way.


### Communication

The major advance in the science of construction over the last few decades has been the perfection of tracking and communication.

Independently, each of the researchers seemed to have realized that no one checklist could anticipate all the pitfalls a team must guard against. So they had determined that the most promising thing to do was just to have people stop and talk through the case together— to be ready as a team to identify and address each patient’s unique, potentially critical dangers.

"That’s not my problem" is possibly the worst thing people can think.


### Best Practices

They provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps— the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all, practical.

You must define a clear pause point at which the checklist is supposed to be used (unless the moment is obvious, like when a warning light goes on or an engine fails). You must decide whether you want a DO-CONFIRM checklist or a READ-DO checklist.

The checklist cannot be lengthy. A rule of thumb some use is to keep it to between five and nine items, which is the limit of working memory.

No matter how careful we might be, no matter how much thought we might put in, a checklist has to be tested in the real world,

Just ticking boxes is not the ultimate goal here. Embracing a culture of teamwork and discipline is.


### Investing 

Guy Spier called it "cocaine brain." Neuroscientists have found that the prospect of making money stimulates the same primitive reward circuits in the brain that cocaine does. And that, Pabrai said, is when serious investors like himself try to become systematic. They focus on dispassionate analysis, on avoiding both irrational exuberance and panic. They pore over the company’s financial reports, investigate its liabilities and risks, examine its management team’s track record, weigh its competitors, consider the future of the market it is in— trying to gauge both the magnitude of opportunity and the margin of safety.

In large part, he believes, the mistakes happened because he wasn’t able to damp down the cocaine brain.

He enumerated the errors known to occur at any point in the investment process— during the research phase, during decision making, during execution of the decision, and even in the period after making an investment when one should be monitoring for problems. He then designed detailed checklists to avoid the errors, complete with clearly identified pause points at which he and his investment team would run through the items.


### Working Together

Aviators, however, add a fourth expectation, discipline: discipline in following prudent procedure and in functioning with others.

We’re obsessed in medicine with having great components— the best drugs, the best devices, the best specialists— but pay little attention to how to make them fit together well. 

"Anyone who understands systems will know immediately that optimizing parts is not a good route to system excellence,"

He gives the example of a famous thought experiment of trying to build the world’s greatest car by assembling the world’s greatest car parts. We connect the engine of a Ferrari, the brakes of a Porsche, the suspension of a BMW, the body of a Volvo . "What we get, of course, is nothing close to a great car; we get a pile of very expensive junk."


### Resistance to using Checklists

There’s something deeper, more visceral going on when people walk away not only from saving lives but from making money. It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an embarrassment. It runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly great among us— those we aspire to be— handle situations of high stakes and complexity. The truly great are daring. They improvise . They do not have protocols and checklists. Maybe our idea of heroism needs updating.

"Did I think the checklist would make much of a difference in my cases? No. In my cases? Please."
